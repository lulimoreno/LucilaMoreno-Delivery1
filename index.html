            <h2> Behind Off-White, <br> the fashion phenomenon </h2>
            <p> Virgil Abloh founded Off-White™ in 2013 as a multi-platform creative endeavor, a space for his
                continuous experimentation. The main medium being fashion yet he combined ideas of streetwear,
                luxury, art, music, and architecture. Virgil's visionary approach to the medium of fashion remains
                iconoclastic and profoundly conceptual yet accessible to a broad global audience.</p>

            <h2> Inspiring change: <br> Virgil Abloh's legacy</h2>
            <p> In November 2021, the sad news of his death as a result of a strange and aggressive cancer that had
                been diagnosed two years ago was announced. His premature disappearance truncated his aspirations to
                be the Karl Lagerfeld of the 21st century. Visionary and messiah of streetwear, he introduced his
                particular vision of fashion into the world of sneakers and influenced a whole new generation of
                consumers.</p>
